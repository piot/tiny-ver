# tiny-ver

> A **tiny** version parser with a big personality!

## üåü Features

- **Simple Parsing:** Easily convert a version string (e.g., `"1.2.3"` or `"1.2.3-rc.1"`) into a `TinyVersion`.
- **Strict Pre-release Validation:** Pre-release identifiers are rigorously checked:
  - Dot-separated identifiers.
  - No empty identifiers.
  - Only ASCII alphanumeric characters and hyphens allowed.
  - Numeric identifiers cannot have leading zeros (unless they are exactly `"0"`).
- **Helper Methods:** Generate versioned names for your projects with a simple method.

## üöÄ Installation

Add `tiny-ver` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tiny-ver = "0.1.0"
```
